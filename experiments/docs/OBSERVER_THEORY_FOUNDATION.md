## Weighted Final Score

**Formula:**
```
Final Score = (
    0.20 × Interest_Alignment +
    0.15 × Personality_Compatibility +
    0.25 × Communication_Quality +
    0.20 × Mutual_Attraction +
    0.10 × Reciprocity_Balance +
    0.10 × Long_Term_Potential
)
```

**Rationale:**
- Communication (25%) is most important for speed dating success
- Interest alignment (20%) and mutual attraction (20%) are critical
- Personality (15%) matters but harder to assess in short interaction
- Reciprocity (10%) and long-term (10%) are secondary in initial meeting

## Rubric for Final Score

- **0-3:** No compatibility — clear misalignment, poor chemistry, awkward interaction
- **4-5:** Low compatibility — some common ground but significant gaps
- **6-7:** Moderate compatibility — decent match, could work but not ideal
- **8-9:** High compatibility — strong alignment on multiple dimensions
- **10:** Perfect match — exceptional chemistry, aligned on all dimensions
