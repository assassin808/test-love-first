--- PERSON 1 (iid=467) ---

I'm a twenty-four-year-old woman, and I'm currently in consulting, which feels like a strong fit for me. When it comes to my free time, I'm extremely active; I love sports and exercise, and hiking is also a considerable passion. I'm also very much into culture and experiences – dining out, visiting museums, appreciating art, going to the theater, catching movies, and attending concerts are all things I enjoy immensely. Music is a huge part of my life, and I also find shopping to be a very pleasant activity. Yoga is something I'm very dedicated to as well. I'm fairly into gaming, and while I enjoy watching sports moderately, I'm much more involved in playing them. I also enjoy clubbing quite a bit and reading is something I'm very passionate about, as is watching TV. Overall, I'd say I'm an extremely fun person to be around. When I think about a partner, I'm looking for someone who brings a balanced mix of attractiveness, sincerity, intelligence, fun, and ambition to the table. Shared interests are not a primary concern for me.
